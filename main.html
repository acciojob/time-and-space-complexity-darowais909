	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm. Rather, it is going to give information about the variation (increase or decrease) in execution time when the number of operations (increase or decrease) in an algorithm. Yes, as the definition says, the amount of time taken is a function of the length of input only.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>O(n)Whenever we write an algorithm or code and run it in our computational device then it requires some space in our device to be executed. The memory here are required for storing the variables, data, temporary results, constants and many more.</p>
